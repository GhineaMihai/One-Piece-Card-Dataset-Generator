# Dataset Generation Scripts

This folder contains helper scripts that were used to **generate and prepare the dataset** for the One Piece Card Manager project.

- These scripts were only intended for **dataset preparation** and are not part of the appâ€™s runtime.  
- The generated dataset was later used by the YOLOv8 model for training and card recognition.  
- Feel free to adapt or extend the scripts if you want to create your own dataset.

These scripts made it easier to build a **custom dataset** that powers the card detection feature of the app.

I included a **classes.txt** and a **dataset.yaml** containing the OP05 set cards, depending on how many cards you want to have, these need to be adapted or created.
